# Project Summary 
The purpose of this project is to build an image auto-tagging model to classify images of the gala nights into 4 categories: Food, misc, Attire, Decoration & Signage.

# Dataset
The dataset can be found in [Hackathon](https://www.hackathon.com/event/auto-tag-images-of-the-gala-with-deep-learning-5e5ce1601c1c92001b638422).
The dataset consists of:
- 2 folders: 'Test Images' and 'Train Images' containing JPG images to train and test
